# 👋 Hi, I'm Jurij Diego Scandola (@jurijscandola)

I'm a 24-year-old student from Italy, currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at Politecnico di Milano.
I'm passionate about Software Engineering and Cybersecurity, and I love creating solutions that are both technically robust and creatively crafted.
I enjoy working in teams and consider myself a capable and supportive team leader. Outside of tech, I'm a musician (guitar and ukulele), a climber, a gym enthusiast, and a passionate writer of books and poetry.
