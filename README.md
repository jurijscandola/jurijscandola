Hi, I’m @jurijscandola, I'm a 24 yo guy from Italy. 
I’m interested in everything related to Software engineering and Cybersecurity topics. 
I’m currently studying Computer Science, at Politecnico di Milano. 
I have past experiences in Backend and Software engineering (mainly Java with different frameworks). 
I’m looking to collaborate on my Master thesis - to be defined yet.
You can reach me on my instagram, @ju.rassico or also LinkedIn.
